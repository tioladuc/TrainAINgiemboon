"Á laa lyɛʼó ŋwɛ́, Saẅi kúʼte Ndavîd; à te nyé yé á piŋ nzèm ńkẅɛ́te tá we wɔ́. ",Saul kept David with him from that day on and did not let him return to his father’s house.
Jÿonataŋ pɔ́ Ndavîd la gwa kʉ̀a mélàʼmie à la ne ńkwoŋo yé páʼ twó mbùm yé. ,Jonathan made a covenant with David   because he loved him as much as himself. 
"Jÿonataŋ la sẅɛ nzsǒ fÿɔ́g ye, ńnáa mbwó Ndavîd, tà mbɔɔ menzsǒ ncù mé, pɔ́ nně ncù ye, ńgÿo kyɛ́d we pɔ́ kwɔb wé.","Then Jonathan removed the robe he was wearing and gave it to David,   along with his military tunic, his sword, his bow, and his belt."
"Á lɔ́ɔn ńgwɔ́ fʉ̀ʼ gie Saẅi tumó Ndavîd ncù, á kúu jʉʼ ntsèm ńjÿó ncù jÿǒ.

Saul put him in command of the fighting men, which pleased all the people and Saul’s servants as well."

","As the troops were coming back, when David was returning from killing the Philistine, the women came out from all the cities of Israel to meet King Saul,   singing and dancing with tambourines, with shouts of joy, and with three-stringed instruments. "
Panzwě pie é la ne ḿbúʼu leluŋó la ne ńzɔbɔ ńgɔɔn ngie:,"As they danced, the women sang:"
"Saẅi la gyáŋa lóŋ tɛʼ; azɔ̀b ŋwɛ́ pú ḿbÿɔ́gɔ yé. Á gɔɔn ngie: Awɛ̂ gẅie mé ne ńnáa pʉ̀a ntsáʼ legém á mbwó Ndavîd, ḿbiŋ ne ńnáa pɔ́ ndàʼ pʉ̀a tàʼ ntsáʼ né mèŋ lɔɔn! Á cʉ́ʼʉ ńzága yé pɔ́ lefùɔ! ","Saul was furious and resented this song. “They credited tens of thousands to David,” he complained, “but they only credited me with thousands. What more can he have but the kingdom? ”   "
"Á la fó lyɛʼó, Saẅi cʉ́ʼʉ ńdíe Ndavîd pɔ́ tepòŋ.",So Saul watched David jealously from that day forward.
"Njÿó gÿo ńdʉ́a, e Ssé túmo tsɔ́ zẅìge tepòŋ, á kúu na Saẅi, á zye légÿo tsɛ̀ɛ ndá páʼ ntsẅìnkʉ̀ Ssé la.

","The next day an evil spirit sent from God came powerfully on Saul,   and he began to rave  # 18:10 Or prophesy inside the palace. David was playing the lyre as usual,  # 18:10 1Sm 16:23 but Saul was holding a spear,  # 18:10 1Sm 19:9 "
"Á leen ńké ńkaʼ lekwoŋ ŋwɛ́ ńnáa tÿǒ, ńgwaa maʼ ńgɔɔn ngie: N ge kime Ndavîd na sagá ndá. Táʼ Ndavîd lÿɔ́ʼ lekwoŋ lÿɔ̌ʼ ńgʉa mbʉ́a. ","and he threw it, thinking, “I’ll pin David to the wall.”   But David got away from him twice."
"Saẅi la ne ḿbɔ́gɔ Ndavîd, á nue Cʉ̀apʉ̀a la gwáʼa yé, pɔ́ Ndavîd zɔ cʉ́ʼ ńgwɔ́. ","Saul was afraid of David,   because the Lord was with David  # 18:12 1Sm 16:13,18 but had left Saul.  # 18:12 1Sm 16:14; 17:36,47; 2Sm 5:2 "

I’ll give her to you as a wife   if you will be a warrior for me and fight the Lord’s battles.”  # 18:17 Nm 21:14; 1Sm 17:36–37; 25:28 But Saul was thinking, “I don’t need to raise a hand against him; let the hand of the Philistines be against him.”  # 18:17 1Sm 18:21,25"
"Ndavîd tsɔ́ʼɔ mbwó Saẅi ngie: N gee páʼɔɔn ńgwɔ́ wɔ́? Atsìŋendá tá wɔ̀ɔn pɔ́ nkenkÿo tsìŋendá ye kuʼu kɔ́ Ésàlayɛ! Ɔɔ fùɔ, ngwɔ́ ń de gwɔ́ tákẅìʼ gù wɔ́! ","Then David responded, “Who am I,   and what is my family or my father’s clan in Israel that I should become the king’s son-in-law? ” "
