When your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me something to eat. Let her prepare a meal in my presence   so I can watch and eat from her hand.’ ”"
"Amnoŋ la nuŋe kǔ ńgÿo páʼ fʉ̀ʼ gie à ne ńguɔ la.

"Angàŋafàʼ jwoŋo Tamaa, ńjÿɔ́ʼ ndá.","Amnon’s servant threw her out and bolted the door behind her. Now Tamar was wearing a long-sleeved   robe, because this is what the king’s virgin daughters wore. "
