"Ábalam pɔ́ nzwě we Salayi la te múɔ zyé. Salayi la gẅiin nkwɔɔn ye, lezíŋ sé gwɔ́ lê Agaa, á gwɔ́ múɔ Egíbtò. ","Abram’s wife, Sarai, had not borne any children for him, but she owned an Egyptian slave named Hagar. "
"Salayi gɔɔn né Ábalam ngie: «Gyá jú páʼ Cʉ̀apʉ̀a kaa zẅíŋ páʼ ngwɔ́ n zyé múɔ wɔ́, shúshu, pi nkwɔɔn yɔɔn nuŋe, ngwɔ́ n dáʼ ńzẅɛ́ʼ pɔ́ yé tá ńgẅiin múɔ.» Ábalam júʼu nò gie Salayi gɔ̌ɔn. ","Sarai said to Abram, “Since the Lord has prevented me from bearing children, go to my slave; perhaps through her I can build a family.” And Abram agreed to what Sarai said.   "
"Salayi gwaa náa Agaa múɔ Egíbtò gẅie á laa ngàŋafàʼ we wemanzwě á mbwó ndúm we Ábalam púʼu, mbà Ábalam tsẅě ngwòŋ Kánàhan ngùʼ legém. ","So Abram’s wife, Sarai, took Hagar, her Egyptian slave, and gave her to her husband, Abram, as a wife for him. This happened after Abram had lived in the land of Canaan ten years. "
"Ábalam pɔ́ Agaa nuŋe, Agaa shwoŋ, ńgÿo ńgwɔ́ tà ńzsé ngie aa shwoŋ, ńcʉ́ʼʉ ńdíe máfàʼ we pɔ́ tepòŋ. ","He slept with   Hagar, and she became pregnant. When she saw that she was pregnant, her mistress became contemptible to her. "
"Salayi leen ńké ńgɔɔn né Ábalam ngie: «Wɔɔn mánẅìle gẅie Agaa lɔgɔ ńkúu wɔ́ɔn lɔɔn, à fóo né gù. Kwàʼ mèŋ zɔ ka gɔɔn ngie pi ngàŋafàʼ wɔ̀ɔn nuŋe.

May the Lord judge between me and you.”  # 16:5 Gn 31:49; Jos 22:25; 1Sm 24:12"
"Ábalam tsɔ́ʼɔ mbwó Salayi ngie: «Ee nkwɔɔn jù, gù zɔ gẅiin nò ńnáa na yé, gÿo páʼ ɔ̀ zsě na yé.» Á cʉa púʼu, Salayi náa Agaa ngɔ́ʼ nǎ tà á gwáʼa yé ńkÿo. ","Abram replied to Sarai, “Here, your slave is in your power; do whatever you want with her.” Then Sarai mistreated her so much that she ran away from her."
"Mántúm Cʉ̀apʉ̀a gyá yé ngʉ̀ŋe tsɔ́ sáʼa ntse gie áa na mánzsè láʼa Shûu, á tsɛ̀ɛ kwòŋotsẅɛ. ","The angel of the Lord    found her by a spring in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur. "
"Ńzɛ́te yé ngie: «Agaa, ngàŋafàʼ Salayi, ɔ̀ fóo né nzɔ̌? Ńgee né nzɔ̌?» Á tsɔ́ʼ ngie: «N gwaʼá máfàʼ wɔ̀ɔn Salayi, ńkÿo.» ","He said, “Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going? ”"
"«Mántúm Cʉ̀apʉ̀a gɔɔn mbwó yé ngie: “Piŋ nzèm, ńtsɛ́ɛ máfàʼ gù. Ḿbiŋ ńjúʼ ncwò wé.” ","The angel of the Lord said to her, “Go back to your mistress and submit to her authority.” "
N ge gÿo gÿo ngẅɛ̀ jù gyɔ́ɔn tà lesáŋ legwɔ́ wó wɔ́. Ńtí nue e ge láʼ gyɔ́ɔn tɛʼ. ,"The angel of the Lord said to her, “I will greatly multiply your offspring,   and they will be too many to count.”"
"Ɔ̀ wɛ̂ ńgwɔ́ shwoŋ, ɔ̀ ge gÿo zyé tàʼ múɔ mbàŋa, é tsẅi lezíŋ sé lê Esemayɛ̂ɛ, ńdɔgɔ ńgɔɔn ngie: “E Ssé jǔʼ.” Ńtí nue Cʉ̀apʉ̀a ka júʼ páʼ ɔ̀ gaʼte. ","The angel of the Lord said to her, “You have conceived and will have a son. You will name him Ishmael,   for the Lord has heard your cry of affliction. "
"Míŋ gù ŋwɛ́ ge gÿo gwɔ́ páʼ nzikáasè mbàʼ, à ge gÿo lÿɔ́ʼ pʉ̀a metsèm lé ncù, epʉ̀a metsèm piŋ ńdÿɔ́ʼɔ yé lé ncù.

His hand will be against everyone, and everyone’s hand will be against him; he will settle near all his relatives.”  "
"Agaa mɔɔn ńgɔɔn ngie: «Tà mèŋ n gee páʼɔɔn mbà mèŋ n gyá nyìŋ gẅie à ne ńgyá wɔ́ɔn lá?» Ńdeen ńké ńná lezíŋ Cʉ̀apʉ̀a gẅie à gɔ̌ɔn nò né yé lê: «Ɛɛ-Loyi,» ńdɔgɔ ńgɔɔn ngie: É Ssé gie e ne ńgyá wɔ́ɔn. ","So she named the Lord who spoke to her: “You are El-roi,”   for she said, “In this place, have I actually seen  # 16:13 Gn 32:30; Ex 33:23; Ps 139:1–12 the one who sees me? ”  # 16:13 Hb obscure "
"Áa mmó gie á gÿo mé tóŋ ntse ntǔŋ ŋwɛ́ gẅie ée tsetsɛ̀ɛ Kandɛ́shÿè pɔ́ Mbelɛd lê ntse ntǔŋ Lahayi-Loyi, ńdɔgɔ ńgɔɔn ngie ntse ntǔŋ Ssé gie e ne ńgyá wɔ́ɔn. ",That is why the well is called Beer-lahai-roi.   It is between Kadesh and Bered.
"Agaa pɔ́ Ábalam zyé tàʼ múɔ mbàŋa, Ábalam ná lezíŋ sé lê Esemayɛ̂ɛ. ","So Hagar gave birth to Abram’s son, and Abram named his son (whom Hagar bore) Ishmael. "
"Agaa la gwaa zyé Esemayɛ̂ɛ míŋ Ábalam, mbà Ábalam gẅiin ngùʼ ntsɔ̀b ntɔgɔ́ lé móm lefɔ̌ɔn.",Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him.
