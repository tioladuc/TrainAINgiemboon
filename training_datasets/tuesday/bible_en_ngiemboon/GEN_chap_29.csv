"Ńgiŋ tà ńkúu tsɔ́ tsẅɛ, ńgyá tsɔ́ ntse ntǔŋ, menjʉ̀njÿò nuŋte ngʉ̀ŋe wó menùɔ méntá, ńne ńzẅɛte. Mélàʼmie mé lɔ́ɔn ńtúʼu ntse menɔ̀ɔn pɔ́ tsɛ̀ɛ wɔɔn ntse ntǔŋ ŋwɛ́, tá ńnáa pɔ́ núu. Mé lɔ́ɔn ńdɔgɔ máa tóon ńziŋe wɔɔn ntse ntǔŋ. ",He looked and saw a well in a field. Three flocks of sheep were lying there beside it because the sheep were watered from this well. But a large stone covered the opening of the well. 
"Menùɔ menɔ̀ɔn lɔ́ɔn ńgwɔ́ tà ḿbú ńcúʼte jʉʼó, mé fóo ncwò ntse ntǔŋ ńzyɛ́bɛ tóon, ńgÿo menɔ̀ɔn núu ntse, tá mé gíŋe ḿbiŋe tóon ńzába ndumó. ",The shepherds would roll the stone from the opening of the well and water the sheep when all the flocks   were gathered there. Then they would return the stone to its place over the well’s opening.
"Yakwɔ̂b zɛ́te papféle menɔ̀ɔn ngie: «Mefɛ̌ pɔ́ɔn, pi fóo wɛ̌ shÿó?» Pɔ́ tsɔ́ʼ ngie: «Peg ée pʉ̀a Alaŋ.» ","Jacob asked the men at the well, “My brothers! Where are you from? ”"
"Á gíŋe ńzɛ́te wɔ́b ngie: «Tà pi ne ńzsé Lambaŋ míŋ Nahɔɔ?» Pɔ́ tsɔ́ʼ ngie: «Oon, peg ne ńzsé yé.» ","“Do you know Laban, Nahor’s grandson? ” Jacob asked them."
Á gíŋe ńzɛ́te wɔ́b ngie: «Aa tentʉ́ʉ?» Pɔ́ tsɔ́ʼ ngie: «À gwɔ̌ pɔ́ ntentʉ́. Míŋ we Lǎshÿɛ̂ wɛ̂ gẅie à ne ńdɔgɔ nùɔ menɔ̀ɔn pé ńtóo lɛ̂.» ,“Is he well? ” Jacob asked.
"Yakwɔ̂b gɔɔn ngie: «Wɔɔn gǐŋ ńgwɔ́ pɔ́ tsɛ̀ɛ zsǒ, afʉ̀ʼ gie mé cúʼte menɔ̀ɔn kaa kuʼu. Pi ná ntse menɔ̀ɔn nú, pi piŋ ńgʉa ḿpféle wɔ́b.» ","Then Jacob said, “Look, it is still broad daylight. It’s not time for the animals to be gathered. Water the flock, then go out and let them graze.”"
"Táʼ, pɔ́ pÿɛ ngie: «Menɔ̀ɔn ntsèm lɔɔn ńnyé te pǔ ńtó tà ńcúʼte jʉʼɔɔn, mbà ngwɔ́ peg é le fʉʼʉ.

Then we will water the sheep.”"
"Pâ pɔ̌ la nyé ne shwóŋe shwoŋé, Lǎshÿɛ̂ lɔgɔ nùɔ menɔ̀ɔn tá we Lambaŋ ńtó. Ńtí nue à laa mpfèle menɔ̀ɔn wemanzwě. ","While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherdess. "
"Yakwɔ̂b la gwɔ́ tà ńgyá Lǎshÿɛ̂ míŋ Lambaŋ gẅie aa fɛ̌ má we, ḿbiŋ ńgyá nùɔ menɔ̀ɔn Lambaŋ, ńgʉa né ngʉ̀ŋe ntse ntǔŋ, éfó ncwò wó ńzyɛ́bɛ tóon, ńtúʼ ntse ńná, menɔ̀ɔn Lambaŋ fɛ̌ má we, nú. ","As soon as Jacob saw his uncle Laban’s daughter Rachel with his sheep,   he went up and rolled the stone from the opening and watered his uncle Laban’s sheep. "
"Yakwɔ̂b péle Lǎshÿɛ̂ kʉ́kʉ́b yé, ńkág tà ńdʉa. ",Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept loudly.   
"Ńdeen ńké shwóŋo Lǎshÿɛ̂ ngie, yé Yakwɔ̂b aa tsɔ̌ métá tá we. Ńgwɔ́ míŋ Lɛpékà. Lǎshÿɛ̂ júʼ, ńkÿote ńgʉa shwóŋo tá we. ","He told Rachel that he was her father’s relative, Rebekah’s son. She ran and told her father."
"Lambaŋ la leen ńjúʼ páʼ míŋ fɛ̌ we tǒ, ńkÿote ńgʉa ńzáʼa yé, ńkyɛ́ ńcʉŋe na ye, ḿbéle yé kʉ́kʉ́b yé, ńdɔgɔ yé ńgʉa né mbʉ̀a yé. Á pú ḿbíte kɔ̀ɔkɔ́ɔ, éshwóŋo Lambaŋ. ","When Laban heard the news about his sister’s son Jacob, he ran to meet him, hugged him, and kissed him. Then he took him to his house, and Jacob told him all that had happened."
"Á cʉa púʼu Lambaŋ gɔɔn né Yakwɔ̂b ngie: «Ɔɔ kwaʼ múɔ ndá weg, ńgwɔ́ metse még.» Ńgÿo púʼu, pɔ́ Yakwɔ̂b tsẅé wó tà ḿmaga saŋ.","Laban said to him, “Yes, you are my own flesh and blood.”  ,# 29:14 Gn 2:23; 37:27; Jdg 9:2; 2Sm 5:1; 19:12–13; 1Ch 11:1"
"Lambaŋ gíŋe ńgɔɔn né Yakwɔ̂b ngie: «Ɔɔ fɛ̌ wɔ̀ɔn, táʼ, ngwɔ́ ń de lɔgɔ yɛ̌ jʉʼ ńgÿo, ɔ̀ faʼa mbwó mèŋ sẅɛ̀ɛ sẅɛ̀ɛ wɔ́. Shwóŋo wɔ́ɔn páʼ n ge péen gú púʼu.» ","Laban said to him, “Just because you’re my relative, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be.”"
"Á laa púʼu Lambaŋ gẅiin púɔ panzwě mépʉ́a: lezíŋ múɔ letwó we, é laa lê Léyà, e se ncʉ̀ʼnzèm we, é gwɔ́ lê Lǎshÿɛ̂. ","Now Laban had two daughters: the older was named Leah, and the younger was named Rachel. "
"Léyà laa múɔ manzwě, eshÿó wé kaba kaba, Lǎshÿɛ̂ piŋ sí tɛʼ. ","Leah had tender eyes, but Rachel was shapely and beautiful. "
"Púʼu, Yakwɔ̂b kwoŋ pɔ́ Lǎshÿɛ̂. Ńgɔɔn né Lambaŋ ngie: «N ge faʼa mbwó gù ngùʼ sɔɔnmbʉ́a, ńzsé ngie ɔ̀ nǎa Lǎshÿɛ̂ nzèm míŋ gù né mèŋ.» ","Jacob loved Rachel, so he answered Laban, “I’ll work for you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.”  "
"Lambaŋ tsɔ́ʼ ngie: «À lɔɔn ńcʉ́ʼ gie n náa yé mbwó tsɔ̌ mámbàŋa ndyɛ̀ʼɛ, ɔ̀ tsẅé jʉʼɔɔn, éfaʼa mbwó mèŋ, n náa yé mbwó gù.»","Laban replied, “Better that I give her to you than to some other man. Stay with me.” "
"Púʼu la, Yakwɔ̂b faʼa mbwó Lambaŋ ngùʼ sɔɔnmbʉ́a, lélɔg ńdúɔ Lǎshÿɛ̂. Táʼ, mɛ̌ mengùʼ sɔɔnmbʉ́a ŋwɛ́ lwo ńtɔ́gɔ mbwó yé; pɔ́ páʼ mbɔ́ melyɛʼɛ́ láʼ la. Ńtí páʼ à la kwoŋo Lǎshÿɛ̂ tɛʼ.

"Lambaŋ cúʼte pʉ̀a jʉʼó ntsèm, ńgÿo máamáa línɔ̀ɔn lɔ́ɔnndá. ",So Laban invited all the men of the place and sponsored a feast. 
"Á gÿo ńgwɔ́ ncwònzsém, Lambaŋ gʉa ńnáa míŋ we Léyà, á mbwó Yakwɔ̂b, pɔ́ yé láʼ. ","That evening, Laban took his daughter Leah and gave her to Jacob, and he slept with her. "
"Lambaŋ náa ngàŋafàʼ we Zilépà né Léyà, páʼ à cʉ́ʼ faʼ pɔ́ mbwó yé. ",And Laban gave his slave Zilpah to his daughter Leah as her slave.
"Njÿó gÿo ńdʉ́a, Yakwɔ̂b gyá, á gwɔ́ pɔ́ Léyà, á kʉʼʉ yé, á zɛ́te Lambaŋ ngie: «Lemaŋ sɔɔn! Yɔɔn ée yɛ̌ ntí nò gie ɔ̀ ka tɔ́ɔn na mèŋ? N kɔ̌ɔn těen faʼa mbwó gù ńtí pɔ́ Lǎshÿɛ̂ wɔ́ le?

"Lambaŋ tsɔ́ʼ ngie: «Áa na tsẅé láʼa yég, mé ée těen ḿvɔgɔ ńnáa nzèm múɔ lɔ́ɔnndá, tá ńgÿo ńnáa mvfò wɔ́. ","Laban answered, “It is not the custom in our country to give the younger daughter in marriage before the firstborn. "

" Cʉ̀apʉ̀a la gyá páʼ mé té Léyà kwoŋ, ńgÿo páʼ ngwɔ́ á zyé. Lǎshÿɛ̂ piŋ ńgwɔ́ pɔ́ nkǐŋ. ","When the Lord saw that Leah was neglected,   he opened her womb;  # 29:31 Gn 30:22 but Rachel was unable to conceive.  # 29:31 Gn 11:30; 25:21; Jdg 13:2–3; 1Sm 2:5; Lk 1:36 "
