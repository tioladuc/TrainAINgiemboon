","Then he showed me the high priest Joshua   standing before the angel of the Lord,  # 3:1 Gn 16:7–13; 21:17; 22:11–16; 31:11–13 with Satan  # 3:1 Or the accuser,# 3:1 1Ch 21:1; Jb 1:6–12; Rv 12:10 standing at his right side to accuse him. "
"Cÿɔ́ʼ Ssé gɔɔn mbwó nyìŋ gẅie à laʼa yé ngie: «Á poŋ ngie Cʉ̀apʉ̀a jÿɔ́ʼ ncwò gú mbà Sátà, oon Cʉ̀apʉ̀a jÿɔ́ʼ ncwò gú, á yé gẅie à ka kaŋa Yelúzálèm!

Isn’t this man a burning stick snatched from the fire? ”  # 3:2 Dt 4:20; Am 4:11"
"Á la gwaa gwɔ́, Yǒonshûa tyé mvfò cÿɔ́ʼ Ssé, ḿmaʼ menzsǒ mie ncÿǒ ée mǒ. ",Now Joshua was dressed with filthy   clothes  # 3:3 Dt 23:13; Is 4:4 as he stood before the angel.  # 3:3 Lv 22:3 
"Cÿɔ́ʼ Ssé gɔɔn mbwó pʉ̀a pie é la tyé mvfò yé ngie: Pi sẅɛ́ menzsǒ mie ée na yé, ńgwɔ́ ncÿǒ ncÿǒ. Ńgíŋ ńgɔɔn né Yǒonshûa ngie: «Líe ńgyá páʼ n ge kẅile lɔ̌ʼ gie áa na gù, é maʼ menzsǒ línɔ̀ɔn na gù.» ","So the angel of the Lord    spoke to those  # 3:4 = the angels standing before him, “Take off his filthy clothes! ” Then he said to him, “See, I have removed your iniquity from you,  # 3:4 2Sm 24:10; Jb 7:21; Mc 7:18 and I will clothe you with festive robes.”"
"Cÿɔ́ʼ Ssé leen ńké ńgíŋ ńgɔɔn ngie mé kwɛ́ɛ mmó nzsǒ gie á ne ńdʉ́ate twó Yǒonshûa! Mè kwɛ́ɛ mmó nzsǒ mbòŋo á twó yé, ḿbiŋ ḿmaʼ menzsǒ mie é ne síi, á na yé. cÿɔ́ʼ Cʉ̀apʉ̀a la gwɔ́ pɔ́ jʉʼó. ","Then I said, “Let them put a clean turban   on his head.” So a clean turban was placed on his head, and they clothed him in garments while the angel of the Lord was standing nearby."
"cÿɔ́ʼ Cʉ̀apʉ̀a leen ńké ńkẅé yɔ̀ɔn ntáŋ, á mvfò Yǒonshûa ńgɔɔn ngie: ","Then the angel of the Lord charged Joshua, "
Cʉ̀apʉ̀a gẅie à piʼi kɔ̀ɔkɔ́ɔ ne ńgɔɔn ngie:,"“This is what the Lord of Armies says: If you walk in my ways and keep my mandates, you will both rule my house and take care of my courts; I will also grant you access among these who are standing here."
"«Yǒonshûa,","“Listen, High Priest Joshua, you and your colleagues sitting before you; indeed, these men are a sign that I am about to bring my servant, the Branch.   "
"Á nue wɔɔn aa tóon gẅie n tÿɔgɔ́ mvfò Yǒonshûa,",Notice the stone   I have set before Joshua; on that one stone are seven eyes.  # 3:9 Zch 4:10 I will engrave an inscription on it” #— #this is the declaration of the Lord of Armies #— #“and I will take away the iniquity of this land in a single day. 
"Á ge láʼ gwɔ́ lyɛ̌ʼ ŋwɛ́,","On that day, each of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and fig tree.”   This is the declaration of the Lord of Armies."
